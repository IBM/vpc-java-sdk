 * The target this collector is collecting flow logs for.
 *
 * - If the target is an instance network attachment, flow logs will be collected
 *   for that instance network attachment.
 * - If the target is an instance network interface, flow logs will be collected
 *   for that instance network interface.
 * - If the target is a virtual network interface, flow logs will be collected for the
 *   virtual network interface's `target` resource if the resource is an instance network
 *   attachment, unless the target resource is itself the target of a flow log collector.
 * - If the target is a virtual server instance, flow logs will be collected
 *   for all network attachments or network interfaces on that instance.
 * - If the target is a subnet, flow logs will be collected
 *   for all instance network interfaces and virtual network interfaces
 *   attached to that subnet.
 * - If the target is a VPC, flow logs will be collected for all instance network
 *   interfaces and virtual network interfaces  attached to all subnets within that VPC.
 *
 * If the target is an instance, subnet, or VPC, flow logs will not be collected for any instance network attachments or
 * instance network interfaces within the target that are themselves the target of a more specific flow log collector.
